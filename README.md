#Course: Ruby Metaprogramming

This is a one-day advanced Ruby training for beginner and intermediate Ruby developers. At the end of the day, attendants will be able to apply advanced Ruby idioms and understand complex code from popular frameworks and libraries.

This is a hands-on training. Attendants will spend most of their time writing code. Even during the most theoretical lessons, they will constantly learn from concrete practice, writing code snippets and short programs.
