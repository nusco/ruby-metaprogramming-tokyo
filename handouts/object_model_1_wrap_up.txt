□ An object is composed of a bunch of instance variables and a link to a class.

□  The methods of an object live in the object’s class. (From the point of view of the class, they’re called instance methods.)

□  The class itself is just an object of class Class. The name of the class is just a constant.

□  Class is a subclass of Module. A module is basically a package of methods. In addition to that, a class can also be instantiated (with new) or arranged in a hierarchy (through its superclass).

□  Constants are arranged in a tree similar to a file system, where the names of modules and classes play the part of directories and regular constants play the part of files.

□  Each class has an ancestors chain, beginning with the class itself and going up to BasicObject.

□  When you call a method, Ruby goes right into the class of the receiver and then up the ancestors chain, until it either finds the method or reaches the end of the chain.

□  When you include a module in a class, the module is inserted in the ancestors chain right above the class itself. When you prepend the module, it is inserted in the ancestors chain right below the class.

□  When you call a method, the receiver takes the role of self.

□  When you’re defining a module (or a class), the module takes the role of "self".

□  Instance variables are always assumed to be instance variables of "self".

□  Any method called without an explicit receiver is assumed to be a method of "self".
